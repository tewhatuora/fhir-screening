  <blockquote>
    <p>
      And now I found myself on a narrow path which followed a small watercourse. I
      was too glad to have an easy track for my flight, to lay hold of the full
      significance of its existence. The thought, however, soon presented itself to
      me that I must be in an inhabited country, but one which was yet unknown. What,
      then, was to be my fate at the hands of its inhabitants? Should I be taken and
      offered up as a burnt-offering to those hideous guardians of the pass? It might
      be so. I shuddered at the thought, yet the horrors of solitude had now fairly
      possessed me; and so dazed was I, and chilled, and woebegone, that I could lay
      hold of no idea firmly amid the crowd of fancies that kept wandering in upon my
      brain.
